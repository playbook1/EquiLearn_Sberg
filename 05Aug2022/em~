Dear Galit, Mahsa, Sahar, Katerina, Rahul:

with quite a bit of interruption due to my rather unusual holiday,
I have now completed a second piece of text that documents
my first programming steps on "Computational Experiments for
Evolutionary Pricing Games". I attach the two LaTeX files
and the python program. The full sources are on Dropbox and
I hope you have access to it, 
Computational Experiments for
Evolutionary Pricing Games
