Dear Galit, Mahsa, Sahar, Katerina, Rahul:

with interruption due to my rather unusual holiday,
I have now completed a second piece of text that documents
my first programming steps on "Computational Experiments for
Evolutionary Pricing Games". I attach the two pdf files
and the python program. The full sources are on Dropbox and
I hope you have access to it, or else via this link:
https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/zoyphde6azx8701kokfp6/h?dl=0&rlkey=hd7wdin73nm0eoef2ks1pn9mh

I would like to keep these source folders neat, with all
derived files suppressed (the ./PLOT folder has some
output), in particular once (and if) we set this up on git.

The new thing is the file readme.pdf which has of a plan of
what to do, of course all for discussion.

Many thanks for your interest! I come back to London on
Monday and we can start any discussion any time.

It's all going well here so far. Talk to you soon,
--Bernhard
